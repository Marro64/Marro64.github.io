Here is a test of page.dir on a webpage which is generated from a markdown file but which isn't a post, this is just a .md file in the root folder.

The part inbetween square brackets should show the contents of page.dir ([/] in this case): [{{ page.dir }}]

And as a control variable, the part inbetween square brackets should show the contents of page.url ([/about] in this case): [{{ page.url }}]
