title: About Marro64
---

Hi! I'm Marro64, a self-proclaimed nerd who's interested in a wide variety of topics. I've learned a lot of things from binging YouTube, and I'm now working to put some of this knowledge into practice. I've just finished my bachelor Creative Technology at the University of Twente and I am now looking for a job in the region of Enschede, Netherlands. Looking to hire? Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinus-bos/) or mail me at [hello@marro.dev](mailto:hello@marro.dev).

Currently my main hobby is Virtual Reality, you can find me in VRChat sometimes, although right now I'm usually busy working on projects for VR instead. I currently live in Enschede, though I'm frequently at my mom's place instead. This means I have 2 computer setups to take care of, each limited in its own way. At my mom's place I've also got a 3D printer that I've had to study inside-out to get working nicely. My other interests include low-level computing and electronics, I'd like to do more with these interests are they're currently mostly theoretical knowledge and little practical experience. This also goes for my interest in retro games, I'm more curious about studying them than actually playing them.

My online name *Marro64* originated as *marrobot*, which is a combination of the first 3 letters of my first name and the word *robot* which I thought up when I was about 9. At some later point I decided to shorten the name to *Marro* as I thought it sounded nicer, and added *64* because of my interest in retro games, and because I thought it sounded cool. Any references to plumbers wearing a red hat are purely coincidental.
