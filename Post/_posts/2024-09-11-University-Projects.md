After graduating, I wanted to make a summary of smaller projects I did during my 3 years as a Creative Technology student. Most of these projects were assignments to learn to use Processing and Arduino. The code to all of these projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Marro64/University-Projects).

## The Last Strand

An art installation about working together to stop waste from entering the ocean. Multiple people must work together to hold up a jug to keep the plastic from entering the water. A counter keeps track of how long since the jug hit the planet. If people don't continuously work together to keep waste at bay, it will not get any better.

Uses an Arduino to sense the height of the jug, and Processing for the display behind. projectDisplay9 is the final version of the Processing code, not all code here is made by me. Processing_Weight is a test of the weight sensor smoothing code. interactiveDemo shows the general concept using spacebar presses. ClockDisplay was a test of the counter using particles to display numbers. Arduino_ultrasonic is the code running on the Arduino measuring the height of the jug.

Group project with 4 people total.

## Alarm Clock
Not a particularly smart alarm clock as the original name might suggest, this project combines the Arduino and programming knowledge from module 2 to create a system connecting the two in a mock practical application.

Processing is used as a fancy display, and Arduino is used to get inputs. Potentiometers are used to set the time. Buttons to enable, disable and snooze the alarm. A light sensor dims the display in the dark, and an LED and beeper let you know when the alarm rings.

Made by me and Denzel Hagen.

## Fishtank

A little fishtank made to combine different programming stuff into one program. Fish flock together, drop food into the tank and they'll eat it. The water splashes and the sand is procedurally generated.

Made by me and Nina Vroom.

## Pong

Pong, playable with analog controls via Arduino. Non-Arduino version made in middle school, with Arduino controls added in university. The analog versions require an Arduino setup, the regular versions use keyboard controls.

Made by me.

## Processing 3 Creature
A little bouncy creature in Processing 3, living a simple life in a window.
Throw him around or just watch him vibe.
Change the creatureCount variable to spawn more creatures in a rainbow of colors.

Made by me.

## Ball Text
This is a showcase of a system to display text from input.txt as a bunch of particles. The color of the particles follow the image in the data folder. Clicking animates the particles, and resizing the window makes the words wrap.

Made by me and Nina.

## Scramble housing

A puzzle game played on those images that real-estate people put behind windows. Move and rotate the pieces till they all connect nicely. Third level is pretty difficult, good luck!

Made by me.

## Slingshot Game

Use the slingshot to bounce your projectile off of the surrounding spheres. Clear all 5 in a set to get an extra projectile to help you towards a high score.

Made by me.

## TricyCOOL

A game made in a game jam lasting a few hours with 4 people in our group. We got 3 random words to base it on, leading to a nonsensical game. Drive a tricycle shooting razors from your cannon up at coloured trousers, match the color. I ended up doing most of the non-graphical work.

I won our team glow-in-the-dark rubber ducks for the class-diagram I made :3

## Firework Wand

A wand which creates fancy starts of various colours and number of points.

Made by me.

## Perlin Field

A field of particles accelerating based on a 3D perlin field.

Made by me.
